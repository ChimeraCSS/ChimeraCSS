## How to Contribute

### Reporting a bug üêõ

**Spot a bug?** We use Github [issues](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/issues) for tracking. Reporting is simple:

1. **Check if the bug exists:** Browse existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. **Report:** [Open a new issue](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/issues/new/choose), providing a clear title and description. Screenshots and code snippets are highly encouraged!

### Discuss the State of the Code üí¨

Engaging in discussions about the current state of the code, potential improvements, and innovative ideas are highly encouraged! 

**Want to start a discussion?** [Create a new discussion](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/discussions/new/choose), choosing the category you want to discuss! 

Here's some of our **Best Practices for Discussion:**

- **Be Respectful:** Respect others' opinions and be open to feedback. We strive for a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- **Stay On Topic:** Keep discussions focused on the technical aspects and how changes can improve the project.
- **Provide Context:** When suggesting changes or highlighting issues, provide as much context as possible. Links to documentation, previous discussions, or examples can be incredibly helpful.
- **Ask Questions:** Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for clarification if something isn‚Äôt clear. Our community is here to help each other.

### Code Contribution ü§ù

Before you dive in, here are some key points to ensure your contributions make a smooth landing:

- **Coding Style:** We use Prettier for formatting. Ensure your code align with our style guide for consistency.
- **SCSS over CSS:** Make your styling changes in `.scss` files, not `.css`. Remember to compile & build your SCSS changes with `sass sass/main.scss css/chimera.css`.
- **Pull Requests:** Ready to submit your code? Open a pull request with a clear list of what you've done. The more detailed, the better!

### Proposing Features üí°

Got an idea for a new feature? We're all ears!! Here's how to propose it:

1. **Check Existing Discussions:** Browse through our [Discussion board](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/discussions) and [Issues](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/issues) to see if your idea has been previously suggested or discussed.
2. **Start with an Issue:** [Open a new issue](https://github.com/ChimeraCSS/ChimeraCSS/issues/new/choose) to discuss your idea. This allows for feedback and collaboration from the community.
3. **Outline the Feature:** Provide a detailed explanation of the feature and its benefits.
